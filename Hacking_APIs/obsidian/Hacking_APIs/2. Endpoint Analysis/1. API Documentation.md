In order to use/consume an API one has to understand the endpoints, request parameters, necessary headers, authentication requirements, and administrative functionality.

An API documentation gives an understanding of these points. If its not directly available there are some possibilities to find it.
- **Brute force:** subdomains and directories for files named "docs", "documentation", etc.
- **Google hacking**: Use search engines and other tools (e.g. Wayback Machine) to find the documentation
  
Its quite common to find a documentation under directories like: 
- https://example.com/docs
- https://example.com/api/docs
- https://docs.example.com
- https://dev.example.com/docs
- https://developer.example.com/docs
- https://api.example.com/docs
- https://example.com/developers/documentation
  
**Don't fully trust the documentation!** There might be endpoints, methods, parameters that are not listed in the documentation.

Usually an API has different **endpoint categories**:
- User/Account management: Sign-up, Login, Logout, etc.
- Data interaction: Search, upload, retrieve, etc.
